MCP server for Bitbucket — built for AI coding agents that need to work with remote repositories **as if they were local clones**: grep-fast code search, windowed file reads, compact token-efficient responses, and a transport layer that never trips Bitbucket's rate limits.

Supports **Bitbucket Server / Data Center** (primary target) and Bitbucket Cloud.

## Why v3

| | v2 | v3 |
|---|---|---|
| Content search in a repo | 1 listing + up to 3,000 file GETs | **1 archive call cold, 0–1 calls warm** |
| Search completeness | silently partial under server throttling | complete, with every cap reported |
| PR diff tokens | per-line JSON (~4× larger) | raw unified diff |
| Read a 100-line window | 2 calls, full file transferred | **1 call, window only** |
| Blame a window of a huge file | up to 100 calls | **1 call** |
| Rate-limit safety | none (burst → 429/403) | client-side pacing sized to DC's limiter |
| Tools | 33 | **25** (~30% less definition context) |

Measured on a live Data Center instance: a repeated content search went from **519 API calls / ~7s** (finding 1 of 8 real matches under burst throttling) to **0 API calls / 24ms** finding all 8. Full design and verified API research: [`REVAMP_PLAN.md`](REVAMP_PLAN.md).

## Tools (48)

### Search (`search`) — Server/DC only
- **`grep`** — search file contents with **full regex, any branch**, like ripgrep on a local clone. One `archive` download per repo+commit, streamed in constant memory, cached in-process, freshness-checked every call (responses carry `as_of <commit>`). Omit `query` for filename-only glob listing. Modes: `content`, `files`, `count`; `glob`, `path`, `context`, `case_insensitive`, `max_results`.
- **`search_code`** — index-backed exact-term search across a whole **project** in one call (default branch only, case-insensitive, no regex, files <512 KiB, ~1000-result window). Best for cross-repo identifier lookups; use `grep` for everything else.
- **`search_repositories`** — find repos by name/description.

### Pull requests (`pr_core`)
- **`get_pull_request`** — metadata + reviewer status + merge info in **1 call**; `include_comments` / `include_file_changes` (default true), `include_tasks`, `comment_limit`. Returns `version` for follow-up mutations.
- **`list_pull_requests`** — repo-scoped; omit `repository` (Server) for **your PRs across all repos** in one call (`role` filter).
- **`create_pull_request`**, **`update_pull_request`**, **`merge_pull_request`**, **`decline_pull_request`** — all mutations accept `version` from a prior read (saves a fetch; auto-refetch + retry once on 409 conflicts).

### Comments & tasks (`pr_comments`)
- **`add_comment`** — general, threaded reply, inline (`file_path` + `line_number`, or `code_snippet` auto-resolution), code `suggestion`, or **task** (`severity: "BLOCKER"`, Server). Attachments upload via the `attachments` param (Server).
- **`manage_comment`** — `edit` / `delete` / `resolve` / `reopen` / `to_task` / `to_comment` on any comment or task, one call with `version`.

### Review (`pr_review`)
- **`get_pull_request_diff`** — raw unified diff text; scope with `file_path` (server-side), `include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns`, `context_lines`, `ignore_whitespace`.
- **`set_review_status`** — `APPROVED` / `NEEDS_WORK` / `UNAPPROVED` (mutually exclusive; one call).

### Commits (`commits`)
- **`list_pr_commits`**, **`list_branch_commits`** (server-side `since`-rev/`merges` filters; bounded page-walk for client-side `author`/`until`/`search`), **`get_commit_detail`** (unified diff, or `detail: "files"` for the changed-file list without bodies).

### Branches (`branches`)
- **`list_branches`**, **`get_branch`** (branch + its PRs), **`delete_branch`** (`expected_head` skips the lookup call).

### Files (`files`)
- **`get_file_content`** — **windowed server-side**: `start_line`/`line_count` transfer only that window (≤5000 lines/call). `full_content` / negative `start_line` for whole-file or tail reads.
- **`get_file_blame`** — commit-span blame for a line window in **1 call** (Server).
- **`list_directory_content`** — paginated, compact.

### Attachments (`attachments`, Server) / Discovery (`discovery`)
- **`manage_attachments`** (`download` capped, `delete`), **`list_projects`**, **`list_repositories`**.

### Repository management (`management`) — Cloud only, opt-in

Off by default. `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT=true` exposes the reads; mutations need
`BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT_WRITE=true` as well. Every mutating tool takes `dry_run`,
which reports the request that would be sent plus the current value and sends
nothing.

Most of these exist at **repository or project** scope — pass `project_key`
instead of `repository` to align a whole project in one call. A repository with
its own explicit setting is not retroactively changed by a project default.

- **`get_repository_settings`** / **`update_repository_settings`** — privacy, fork policy, main branch, project move, wiki/issues, rename. Renaming changes the **slug**, so clone URLs change with it.
- **`list_branch_restrictions`** / **`manage_branch_restriction`** — all 18 restriction kinds, `glob` or `branching_model` matching, user/group exemptions. `set` is idempotent by kind+pattern: it updates the existing record instead of stacking a second one.
- **`get_branching_model`** / **`manage_branching_model`** — development/production branches and branch-type prefixes; repo or project scope.
- **`list_default_reviewers`** / **`manage_default_reviewer`** — repo or project scope. The user is a UUID in braces or an account id, not a bare username.
- **`list_repository_permissions`** / **`manage_repository_permission`** — user *or* group (exactly one), repo or project scope.
- **`get_pipelines_config`** / **`manage_pipelines_config`** — the Pipelines on/off switch, plus schedules.
- **`list_pipeline_variables`** / **`manage_pipeline_variable`** — repository, workspace, or deployment-environment scope; idempotent by key. Secured values are never returned, so the `secured` flag is what distinguishes hidden from empty.
- **`manage_pipeline_run`** — trigger a pipeline on a ref (optional custom selector and variables) or stop a running one.
- **`list_webhooks`** / **`manage_webhook`** — repo or workspace scope.
- **`list_deploy_keys`** / **`manage_deploy_key`**, **`list_environments`** / **`manage_environment`**.
- **`create_repository`**, **`delete_repository`** — deletion is irreversible and requires `confirm_full_name` to equal `workspace/repository` exactly.

Scopes are the usual blocker, not permissions. Bitbucket returns the scope it
wanted in `error.detail.required`, and these tools surface that array verbatim:

| Capability | Token scope |
|---|---|
| Branch restrictions, branching-model settings, Pipelines on/off, repo settings, default reviewers, deploy keys, `create_repository` | `admin:repository` |
| Pipeline variables, environments | `admin:pipeline` |
| Project-scope settings | `admin:project` |
| Repository permissions | `admin:repository` + `write:permission` |
| `delete_repository` | `delete:repository` |
| Deleting a webhook (creating one only needs `write:webhook`) | `delete:webhook` |

## Output conventions

- Bulk content (diffs, files, grep results) is **plain text**, not JSON-escaped strings; lists are compact JSON without pretty-printing. Dates are ISO-8601.
- Content-derived responses carry `as_of <commit>` so the agent knows exactly which state it saw.
- **Truncation is never silent** — every cap produces an explicit warning with continuation guidance (`next_start`, "narrow the glob", etc.).
- Mutable entities include `version`, so mutations don't need a re-read.

## Installation

### Using npx (recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bitbucket": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nexus2520/bitbucket-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "your.username",
        "BITBUCKET_TOKEN": "your-http-access-token",
        "BITBUCKET_BASE_URL": "https://bitbucket.yourcompany.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Bitbucket Cloud use `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD` instead of `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` (and omit `BITBUCKET_BASE_URL`).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdogra1299/bitbucket-mcp-server.git
cd bitbucket-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
# point your MCP config at: node <repo>/build/index.js
```

## Configuration

Every numeric policy is environment-tunable — nothing is hard-coded. The full table lives in [`src/config/index.ts`](src/config/index.ts) (`CONFIG_REFERENCE`). The ones that matter most:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BITBUCKET_RATE_LIMIT_RPS` | `5` | Client-side sustained request rate (DC's per-user refill is 5/s). `0` disables pacing — set this if your account has an admin rate-limit exemption |
| `BITBUCKET_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | `50` | Burst capacity (DC's server bucket is 60) |
| `BITBUCKET_GLOBAL_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Max in-flight requests across all tools |
| `BITBUCKET_SNAPSHOT_MAX_MB` | `256` | In-memory grep cache budget. `0` = pure streaming (no retention, still 2 calls per search) |
| `BITBUCKET_SNAPSHOT_MAX_FILE_KB` | `2048` | Files larger than this are scanned but not cached |
| `BITBUCKET_REF_RESOLVE_TTL_MS` | `15000` | Branch→SHA freshness memo; `0` = validate on every single call |
| `BITBUCKET_STREAM_ABORT_MB` | `2048` | Abort archive scans past this many extracted MB (falls back to bounded per-file scan) |
| `BITBUCKET_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-request timeout |
| `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS` | all | Comma-separated groups to expose (validated, enforced at dispatch, fails closed) |
| `BITBUCKET_DIALECT` | from base URL | Force `cloud` or `server`. Unset derives it from the base URL — `api.bitbucket.org` is Cloud, anything else is Server/DC |
| `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT` | `false` | Expose the repository-management tools at all |
| `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT_WRITE` | `false` | Allow the **mutating** management tools. Needs `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT` too |

### Authentication and dialect

Auth scheme and API dialect are independent. Basic auth uses
`BITBUCKET_USERNAME` + `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD` (on Cloud, that is your email
plus an API token). `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` sends a bearer token instead and needs no
username — which is the only way to use a Bitbucket Cloud **repository** or
**workspace access token**, since those reject Basic auth outright.

The dialect comes from the base URL, not from which credential you supplied, so
a bearer token against Cloud stays on the Cloud API. Override with
`BITBUCKET_DIALECT` if you front the API with something whose hostname does not
give it away.

### The grep engine's guarantees

- **Memory-bounded**: the archive is streamed, never buffered whole; the cache is a hard byte budget with LRU eviction and content-hash dedup across branches. Worst case = budget + a few MB transient.
- **Fresh**: every query re-resolves the branch head; a moved branch can never serve stale results. Merges/deletes made through this server invalidate immediately.
- **Complete**: cache limits never reduce scan coverage — oversized files are still scanned; only true binaries are skipped, and they're counted in the output.

### Rate limiting

All requests flow through a token bucket sized to Bitbucket DC's per-user limiter, so 429s are avoided rather than retried-after. If your instance throttles hard anyway, the error message says exactly what to do — the durable fix is asking a Bitbucket admin for a **rate-limit exemption** for the service account (Admin → Rate limiting → Exemptions), then setting `BITBUCKET_RATE_LIMIT_RPS=0`.

## Migrating from v2

Removed tools and their v3 equivalents (same capabilities, fewer tools):

| v2 | v3 |
|---|---|
| `find_in_files` | `grep` with `query` |
| `search_files` | `grep` without `query` (use `glob`) |
| `list_pr_tasks` | `get_pull_request` + `include_tasks: true` |
| `create_pr_task` | `add_comment` + `severity: "BLOCKER"` |
| `update_pr_task` | `manage_comment` `action: "edit"` |
| `delete_pr_task`, `delete_comment` | `manage_comment` `action: "delete"` |
| `set_pr_task_status` | `manage_comment` `action: "resolve"` / `"reopen"` |
| `convert_pr_item` | `manage_comment` `action: "to_task"` / `"to_comment"` |
| `set_pr_approval` | `set_review_status` `status: "APPROVED"` / `"UNAPPROVED"` |

Update Claude Code permission allowlists (`mcp__bitbucket__*`) accordingly. Diff tools now return unified diff text instead of per-line JSON — line numbers come from `@@` headers. Full details in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # tsc → build/

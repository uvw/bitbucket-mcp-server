## [Unreleased] — fork `feat/management`

Repository administration behind two opt-in gates, plus the auth change it
needed. Cloud only; Server/DC exposes a different admin API entirely.

### Added

- **23 repository-management tools (`management` group).** Branch restrictions (all 18 kinds, glob or branching-model matching, user/group exemptions), branching model, repository settings, default reviewers, repository permissions, Pipelines on/off, pipeline variables (repo/workspace/deployment-environment), pipeline runs, webhooks, deploy keys, deployment environments, and repository create/delete. Most accept `project_key` instead of `repository` to apply at **project** scope — one call per project rather than per repository.
- **Two independent gates.** `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT` exposes the group; `BITBUCKET_MANAGEMENT_WRITE` is required again for anything mutating, so the read side can audit a fleet while writes stay impossible. Both default off, and a gated-off tool is not callable by name — `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS` could not serve this, since unset means "every group".
- **`dry_run` on every mutating management tool.** Reports the request that would be sent plus the current value, and sends nothing.
- **`BITBUCKET_DIALECT`** to force `cloud` or `server` when the base URL is not self-evident.
- **`cloud_only` tool availability**, alongside the existing `both` / `server_only`.

### Changed

- **The API dialect now comes from the base URL, not from which credential field is set.** `isServer = !!auth.token` conflated auth scheme with API shape: an ambient `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` silently drove a Cloud server with Server/DC paths (every request 404ing while auth looked fine), and Cloud could not be used with a bearer credential at all — which is what Bitbucket Cloud repository and workspace access tokens require, since they reject Basic auth.
- **`BITBUCKET_USERNAME` is no longer required with a bearer token.** Access tokens have no username. The Server participants path still needs one and now says so.
- **Insufficient-scope 403s surface `error.detail.required` verbatim.** A generic 403 sends people hunting through repository permissions for what is actually an unticked box at mint time.
- **`set` operations are idempotent under an inconsistent listing.** Bitbucket's pipeline-variables collection is eventually consistent — a variable created a moment earlier is absent from the next listing — so create-then-conflict falls back to reading again and updating. Branch restrictions get the same treatment; they report the clash in prose rather than a 409.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-09

Complete revamp: grep-like repo search, drastically fewer Bitbucket API calls, rate-limit-safe transport, compact token-efficient responses, and a consolidated 25-tool surface. Design and verified API research in `REVAMP_PLAN.md`.

### Added

- **`grep` tool — search a repo like ripgrep on a local clone (Server/DC only).** One `archive?at=<sha>` download per repo+commit is streamed (tar.gz, constant memory), regex-scanned line-by-line, and cached in an in-memory byte-budget LRU with content-hash blob dedup across branches. Warm queries cost **1 API call** (the freshness check) instead of a listing + up to 3000 raw file GETs. Full regex, any branch, no index gaps, `content`/`files`/`count` modes, context lines, ripgrep-style output with `as_of <commit>`. Falls back to a bounded per-file scan when the archive endpoint is unavailable. Completeness contract: retention caps never reduce scan coverage (oversized text files are stream-scanned and re-fetched individually on warm hits); binaries are skipped and counted, never silent.
- **Client-side rate-limit pacing.** All requests flow through a token bucket sized to Bitbucket DC's per-user limiter (default 5 req/s sustained, burst 50 — DC's server default is 60/5) plus a global concurrency cap, making 429s mathematically avoidable on default instances. Bounded retries with full-jitter backoff (Retry-After honored opportunistically; DC documents none), in-flight GET coalescing, keep-alive sockets, request timeouts.
- **Central config module (`src/config`).** Every numeric policy (rate limits, retries, snapshot budgets, page sizes, truncation caps) is env-overridable — nothing hard-coded at call sites. See `CONFIG_REFERENCE` for the full table. Legacy env names (`BITBUCKET_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM`, `BITBUCKET_MAX_SCAN_FILES`, …) still work.
- **`version` pass-through on all mutations.** `update/merge/decline_pull_request` and `manage_comment` accept the entity `version` from a prior read (now included in `get_pull_request`/list outputs), turning 2-call mutations into 1 call, with an automatic refetch-and-retry on 409 conflicts.
- **Cross-repo PR listing.** `list_pull_requests` without `repository` uses the dashboard endpoint (Server) — "my PRs across all repos" in one call.

### Changed

- **Diffs are raw unified diff text** (`Accept: text/plain`) — ~5–10× fewer tokens than the old per-line JSON objects with zero information loss (line numbers derive from `@@` headers). Applies to `get_pull_request_diff` and `get_commit_detail`; `get_commit_detail` gains `detail:"files"` for a body-less changed-file list.
- **`get_file_content` reads a line window server-side in ONE call** (browse endpoint pages over lines; ≤5000/page) instead of metadata + full raw download; `full_content`/negative `start_line` still fetch whole files.
- **`get_file_blame` fetches only the pages covering the requested window** — a 50-line blame in a 100k-line file is 1 call (was up to 100). Output is a compact commit legend + line spans.
- **`get_pull_request` is 1 call for metadata** (merge commit + closed date + comment/task counts come from the PR resource itself) and at most 3–4 with `include_comments`/`include_file_changes`/`include_tasks` (tasks via the `blocker-comments` endpoint, DC 7.2+). Activities pagination is honest: server clamps at 500/page and truncation is reported (the old `limit=1000` silently lost data). `merged_by` is extracted from the same activities page that serves comments — no extra calls.
- **`search_code`**: the redundant case-variant second query is removed (the index is case-insensitive per Atlassian docs); the zero-hit index-gap probe is a single one-page listing (was up to 40 calls); pagination stops with steering text at the search server's ~1000-result window; output is ripgrep-style text.
- **All responses compacted**: no pretty-printed JSON, ISO-8601 dates, no argument echoes or derivable fields, bulk content as plain text blocks, all truncation explicitly marked, error details capped, text attachment downloads capped (config).
- **Repo restructured**: `src/{config,core,formatting,handlers,tools,types}` with a canonical types barrel, `type` aliases only (no `interface`), and a tool registry that enforces group/availability filtering at dispatch (hidden tools are no longer callable by name). `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS` values are validated with warnings.

### Removed (breaking — consolidation, same capabilities)

| v2 tool | v3 replacement |
|---|---|
| `find_in_files` | `grep` (query = regex) |
| `search_files` | `grep` (omit query; `glob`) |
| `list_pr_tasks` | `get_pull_request` with `include_tasks: true` |
| `create_pr_task` | `add_comment` with `severity: "BLOCKER"` |
| `update_pr_task` | `manage_comment` `action: "edit"` |
| `delete_pr_task` / `delete_comment` | `manage_comment` `action: "delete"` |
| `set_pr_task_status` | `manage_comment` `action: "resolve"` / `"reopen"` |
| `convert_pr_item` | `manage_comment` `action: "to_task"` / `"to_comment"` |
| `set_pr_approval` | `set_review_status` `status: "APPROVED"` / `"UNAPPROVED"` |

Update Claude Code permission allowlists (`mcp__bitbucket__*`) and prompts accordingly. 33 → 25 tools; tool-definition context cost drops ~30%.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Auth and server errors now include Bitbucket's request id for log correlation.** 401 (authentication failed), 403 (permission denied), and generic API error messages append `[bitbucket-ref: <x-arequestid>]` when Bitbucket returns the `x-arequestid` response header, so operators can correlate a failure to the exact entry in the Bitbucket Data Center access logs. No change when the header is absent; 404 responses are untouched. ([#16](https://github.com/pdogra1299/bitbucket-mcp-server/pull/16))

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **`find_in_files` no longer fabricates rate-limit errors from permission denials.** Previously, 3 consecutive HTTP 403s aborted the whole scan and reported `RATE_LIMITED: Bitbucket returned 429/403...` — but 403 is authorization, not throttling, so a permission-scoped directory could falsely kill the scan. 403'd files are now skipped individually and reported via a new `PERMISSION_DENIED` warning (with `files_permission_denied` in diagnostics); the scan continues. The racy shared `consecutive403s` counter is gone. Only HTTP 429 means rate-limiting.
- **HTTP 429 during a scan is retried instead of instantly aborting.** Each throttled file fetch is retried up to 3 attempts, honoring the `Retry-After` header (fallback: 2s/4s exponential backoff with jitter, 30s cap). Only after retries are exhausted does the scan stop — keeping all results gathered so far — with an accurate `RATE_LIMITED` warning.
- **Repository file listings now paginate.** `find_in_files`, the index-gap probe, and `search_files` previously issued a single `limit=100000` request and silently dropped everything past the first page on instances that clamp page size. Listings now follow `isLastPage`/`nextPageStart` (Server) and the `next` cursor (Cloud, `search_files`), and surface `FILE_LIST_TRUNCATED` / `file_list_truncated` when the pagination safety cap is genuinely hit.
- **`get_file_blame` reports truncation.** If the 100-page safety cap stops blame pagination early, the response now carries `truncated: true` and a warning instead of silently returning partial blame.
- **Real Bitbucket throttling is labeled as such.** `handleApiError` now maps HTTP 429 to a clear "Rate limited by Bitbucket" message including `Retry-After` when present, instead of the generic API-error text.

### Added

- **In-memory file-list cache (60s TTL)** shared by `find_in_files`, the index-gap probe, and `search_files` — repeated searches against the same repo/branch no longer re-download the full file tree each call. API-only; nothing is written to disk.
- **`comment_limit` parameter on `get_pull_request`** (default 20, previously a hard-coded slice) to fetch more active comments when a PR has long discussions.
- **Env-tunable scan knobs:** `BITBUCKET_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM` (default 4), `BITBUCKET_MAX_PARALLELISM` (cap 20), `BITBUCKET_MAX_SCAN_FILES` (default 3000).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **File attachments (Bitbucket Server / Data Center only).** Upload local files and embed them in PR comments and descriptions:
  - New **`attachments`** parameter on `add_comment`, `create_pull_request`, and `update_pull_request`. Each item is a local file path string or `{ file_path, alt_text?, render? }`. Files are uploaded to the repository and a Markdown reference (`attachment:N/M`) is appended automatically — `render: "image"` embeds inline (`![alt](…)`), `"link"` embeds a download link, `"auto"` (default) picks based on file type. For `update_pull_request`, attachments-only updates append to the existing description instead of replacing it.
  - New **`manage_attachments`** tool (new `attachments` tool group, Server only) with `action: "download"` (returns text/image/metadata by numeric id) and `action: "delete"` (by numeric id, requires `REPO_ADMIN`). No `list` action — Bitbucket exposes no attachment-listing API.
  - **Bitbucket Cloud** has no public attachment API; using `attachments` or `manage_attachments` on a Cloud connection returns a clear, explanatory error.

### Changed

- **API client** gained multipart upload (`uploadAttachment`) and binary download (`downloadAttachment`) support; previously the client was JSON-only. The upload posts to the prefix-less `/projects/{key}/repos/{slug}/attachments` path (the servlet that actually accepts uploads on Bitbucket DC), falling back to the `/rest/api/1.0/...` form, and sends `Accept: */*` — verified against a live Bitbucket Data Center instance where axios's default `Accept` header is rejected with HTTP 405 by the fronting proxy. Download/delete use the documented `/rest/api/1.0/.../attachments/{id}` resource (delete requires `REPO_ADMIN`).
- Added `form-data` as a direct dependency (previously only transitive via axios).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`find_in_files` tool** — Content search by listing files and reading them through the raw endpoint. The escape hatch for everything Bitbucket's index does not cover: full PCRE regex, languages the index ignores (e.g. `.hs`), feature branches, and files Bitbucket's index missed despite indexing the language. Same dense JSON output as `search_code`. Concurrency-capped (default 4) with rate-limit detection (429 aborts immediately; 3+ consecutive 403s aborts; transient single 403s are tolerated as per-file permission denials). Surfaces honest diagnostics: `files_scanned`, `files_attempted`, `files_failed`, `files_truncated`. **Bitbucket Server only.**

- **New `search_code` parameters** mapping directly to documented Bitbucket modifiers:
  - `lang` (`lang:`), `ext` (`ext:`), `path` (`path:`), `archived` (`archived:`), `fork` (`fork:`), `exclude_terms` (each becomes `-term`).
  - `regex_filter` — client-side regex applied to returned hit lines as a post-filter; lets you narrow without spending Bitbucket query budget.
  - `case_variants` — runs the query with snake_case ↔ camelCase converted and merges results in one tool call.

- **Index-reach probe** — when `search_code` returns zero hits, the server lists matching files via the same filters; if files exist it surfaces an `INDEX_GAP_LIKELY` warning that names the file count, calls out an unrecognized `lang:` filter when present, and tells the LLM to fall back to `find_in_files`. Distinguishes `PROBE_UNAVAILABLE` (probe could not run) from real zero-results.

- **Soft-degrade query builder** — Bitbucket caps queries at 250 characters and 9 expressions. When constructed clauses exceed either cap, optional clauses (drop priority: `exclude_terms` → `archived` → `fork` → `ext` → `lang` → `path` → `repo`) are removed one at a time with a `QUERY_TRUNCATED` warning. Previously this returned a hard error.

- **Dense JSON response shape** for both search tools:
  - Only matched lines are returned (previously surrounding-context lines were rendered as if they were matches, inflating output ~10x).
  - Distinct `total_files` and `total_matches`, plus an `engine` field (`bitbucket_index` or `find_in_files`) so callers know which path served the result.
  - `diagnostics` block exposes `expression_count`, `query_length`, `dropped_clauses`, and (for `find_in_files`) honest scan counts.

- **Structured warnings** at every failure mode: `INDEX_GAP_LIKELY`, `REGEX_FILTER_REJECTED_ALL`, `PROBE_UNAVAILABLE`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `FETCH_FAILURES`, `FILES_TRUNCATED`, `POSSIBLE_FALSE_NEGATIVE`, `QUERY_TRUNCATED`, `INVALID_REGEX`, `DEPRECATED_PARAM`. Each names the specific cause and the next action.

### Changed

- **Tool descriptions rewritten** for `search_code`, `find_in_files`, `search_files`, `search_repositories`. Lead with USE WHEN / DO NOT USE WHEN, document Bitbucket index quirks (punctuation stripping, ALL-CAPS operators, single-character terms ignored), and state hard limits (250-char query, 9 expressions, 512 KiB per file, default branch only). Language-neutral throughout — no per-language regex tables baked into the server.

- **`search_code` parameter renames** — `search_query` → `query`, `file_pattern` → `ext` / `path`. Old names still accepted with a `DEPRECATED_PARAM` warning. `search_context` and `include_patterns` are accepted but ignored with a deprecation warning (their patterns collapsed at index time due to Bitbucket's punctuation-stripping behavior).

- **`search_repositories`** modernized to the dense JSON shape; accepts both `query` and `search_query` (deprecated).

### Fixed

- **`search_code` smart-query layer was a no-op.** The previous `buildContextualPatterns` generated 7 OR'd patterns (`"foo ="`, `"foo:"`, `"function foo"`, etc.) that all collapsed to bare-term searches at index time because Bitbucket strips punctuation other than `.` and `_`. Worse, the OR-expanded query overflowed the 250-character cap for any identifier roughly 16 characters or longer, returning a hard error. Removed in favor of raw query passthrough plus optional `regex_filter` post-filter.

- **Output bloat** — `formatCodeSearchOutput` printed every line in `hitContexts` (including blank lines, docstring fences, surrounding context) as `Line N: ...`, conflating actual hits with their surroundings. Replaced with a hit-only formatter that filters on Bitbucket's `<em>` markers.

- **Silent fetch failures** in file fan-outs were treated as "no match" and returned with confidence. Now tracked separately; `FETCH_FAILURES` warning includes counts and a sample of failing paths.

- **Inconsistent API path versions** — `listFiles` used `/rest/api/latest/...` while raw content used `/rest/api/1.0/...`. Unified to `latest`.

- **Filters JSON included `undefined` keys** — now stripped.

### Notes

- The Bitbucket index itself has known coverage gaps that cannot be fixed from the MCP layer (e.g. some real source files are simply missing from the index even on the default branch, languages like Haskell appear unindexed in some installations). This release does not paper over those gaps; it makes them visible to the LLM via `INDEX_GAP_LIKELY` and provides `find_in_files` as a working recovery path.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`get_file_blame` tool** — Per-line blame for a file: who last modified each line, the commit hash, author, and timestamp. Supports `branch`, `start_line`/`line_count` windowing, and `group_by_commit` to toggle between range-compressed output (default) and one-entry-per-line output. Feed the returned `commit_id` into `get_commit_detail` to see what actually changed. **Bitbucket Server only** — Bitbucket Cloud does not expose a blame API.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **`get_commit_detail` tool** — Get the diff for a specific commit (by SHA) with structured line-by-line information. Supports `context_lines`, `file_path`, `include_patterns`, and `exclude_patterns` filtering. Works on both Bitbucket Server (structured JSON response) and Bitbucket Cloud (unified diff with optional filtering).

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Validate `search_code` query length before calling Bitbucket API** — returns a clear error when the constructed query exceeds Bitbucket's 250-character limit, preventing a confusing API-level failure and showing the full constructed query to help users shorten their search

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Republish to restore README display on npm registry page

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Merged 8 inverse-operation tool pairs into 4 unified tools** — any client or LLM prompt referencing the old tool names must be updated:

  | Removed (old) | Replacement |
  |---|---|
  | `approve_pull_request` | `set_pr_approval` with `approved: true` |
  | `unapprove_pull_request` | `set_pr_approval` with `approved: false` |
  | `request_changes` | `set_review_status` with `request_changes: true` |
  | `remove_requested_changes` | `set_review_status` with `request_changes: false` |
  | `mark_pr_task_done` | `set_pr_task_status` with `done: true` |
  | `unmark_pr_task_done` | `set_pr_task_status` with `done: false` |
  | `convert_comment_to_task` | `convert_pr_item` with `direction: "to_task"` |
  | `convert_task_to_comment` | `convert_pr_item` with `direction: "to_comment"` |

- **Removed fields from `list_pull_requests` response** — slim list format no longer includes `is_open`, `is_closed`, `api_url`, `description`. Use `get_pull_request` for full details.

- **Removed fields from `list_projects` / `list_repositories` responses** — `id`, `state`, `is_forkable`, `clone_urls` removed (not useful for LLM navigation).

- **Removed fields from commit responses** — `author.email` and `parents[]` removed from `FormattedCommit`. Use `is_merge_commit` boolean (retained) instead of checking `parents.length`.

- **Removed fields from file/directory responses** — `size` removed from `list_directory_content` entries; `size` and `encoding` removed from `get_file_content`; `workspace`, `repository`, `total_files_scanned` removed from `search_files`.

- **Removed fields from diff response** — `message`, `from_hash`, `to_hash` removed from `get_pull_request_diff` structured response.

### Added

- **Tool group filtering via `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS` environment variable**:
  - Set a comma-separated list of group names to expose only the tools your use case needs
  - Groups: `pr_core`, `pr_comments`, `pr_review`, `pr_tasks`, `commits`, `branches`, `files`, `search`, `discovery`
  - Example: `BITBUCKET_TOOL_GROUPS=pr_core,pr_review,files` exposes only 12 tools (~2,100 tokens) instead of all 29
  - When unset, all applicable tools are exposed (default behaviour)

- **Automatic server-only tool filtering for Bitbucket Cloud**:
  - When connected to Bitbucket Cloud, 10 server-only tools are automatically hidden from the LLM
  - Cloud users see 21 tools instead of 29, saving ~1,100 tokens per request without any configuration
  - Server-only tools: `list_pr_tasks`, `create_pr_task`, `update_pr_task`, `set_pr_task_status`, `delete_pr_task`, `convert_pr_item`, `list_branch_commits`, `search_code`, `search_repositories`, and `search_files`

- **Tool group metadata** on every tool definition (`group` + `availability` fields) for runtime filtering

### Changed

- **Token usage reduced by ~25% (Server) to ~43% (Cloud)** in tool definition payload sent to LLM on every request:
  - Before: 33 tools, ~6,800 tokens
  - After (Server, all groups): 29 tools, ~5,100 tokens
  - After (Cloud, auto-filtered): 21 tools, ~3,900 tokens
  - After (minimal group preset): 12 tools, ~2,100 tokens

- **Shared parameter constants** (`W`, `R`, `PRID`, `BRANCH`, `LIMIT`, `START`, `TASK_ID`) used across all tool definitions to avoid repeating identical parameter descriptions

- **Compressed tool descriptions** — all tool and parameter descriptions trimmed to remove redundant wording while preserving full semantic meaning

- **Author filter in `list_branch_commits`** now matches by `author.name` only (email was removed from `FormattedCommit`)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- **New `search_files` tool for finding files by name or path pattern**:
  - Search for files using glob patterns (e.g., `*.ts`, `**/*Controller*`, `src/**/*.res`)
  - Case-insensitive matching for user-friendly searches (like VS Code's Ctrl+P)
  - Supports searching within specific subdirectories via `path` parameter
  - Branch selection support to search files on any branch
  - Configurable result limit (default: 100) with truncation indicator
  - Returns comprehensive response with:
    - Matched file paths
    - Total files scanned in repository
    - Total matches found
    - Truncation status when results exceed limit
  - Works with both Bitbucket Server and Cloud
  - Uses Bitbucket Server's `/files` endpoint for efficient recursive file listing
  - Client-side glob filtering using `minimatch` library

### Technical Details

- Added `isSearchFilesArgs` type guard for input validation
- Added `handleSearchFiles` method to `FileHandlers` class
- Uses `minimatch` with `matchBase: true` and `nocase: true` options for flexible pattern matching
- Bitbucket Server: Single API call fetches all files recursively
  - Bitbucket Cloud: Uses `/src` endpoint with `max_depth` parameter

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Pinned `minimatch` to `9.0.5` to avoid `9.0.6` runtime crash for `npx` consumers**
  - Ensures registry installs do not pull the broken `9.0.6` release

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- **New `search_repositories` tool (Bitbucket Server only)**:
  - Search for repositories by name or description across all accessible projects
  - Optional filtering by project/workspace
  - Uses Bitbucket Server's search API for efficient repository discovery
  - Configurable result limit

- **New `decline_pull_request` tool**:
  - Decline/reject a pull request with optional comment
  - Works with both Bitbucket Server and Cloud
  - Fetches current PR version automatically to handle optimistic locking

- **New `delete_comment` tool**:
  - Delete a comment from a pull request
  - Handles version tracking automatically
  - Returns appropriate error for comments with replies (which cannot be deleted)
  - Only comment author, PR author, or repo admin can delete comments

- **New PR Task Management tools (Bitbucket Server only)**:
  - Tasks are checklist items on pull requests (implemented as BLOCKER severity comments)
  - `list_pr_tasks` - List all tasks on a PR with open/resolved summary
  - `create_pr_task` - Create a new task directly on a PR
  - `update_pr_task` - Edit the text of an existing task
  - `mark_pr_task_done` - Mark a task as resolved
  - `unmark_pr_task_done` - Reopen a resolved task
  - `delete_pr_task` - Delete a task from a PR
  - `convert_comment_to_task` - Convert a regular comment to a task
  - `convert_task_to_comment` - Convert a task back to a regular comment

### Changed

- Enhanced `BitbucketServerSearchRequest` type to include `repositories` entity and `limits` for pagination
- Enhanced `BitbucketServerSearchResult` type to include repository search results
- Added new type guards for all new tools
- Updated README with comprehensive documentation for all new tools

### Technical Details

- Tasks use `severity: "BLOCKER"` for tasks and `severity: "NORMAL"` for regular comments
- Task state can be `OPEN` or `RESOLVED`
- All task operations require version tracking for optimistic locking

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Structured diff response for `get_pull_request_diff` tool (Bitbucket Server)**:
  - Returns structured JSON with line-by-line information instead of raw unified diff
  - Each line includes `source_line`, `destination_line`, `type` (ADDED/REMOVED/CONTEXT), and `content`
  - Files organized into hunks with start positions and spans
  - Makes it easy for AI tools to add inline comments with correct line numbers
  - Native file path filtering via Bitbucket API (added file path to URL)

### Changed
- **Bitbucket Server now uses JSON API** (`Accept: application/json`) instead of text/plain for diff endpoint
- Response format changed from `{ diff: "raw diff string" }` to structured `{ files: [...] }` format
- Updated tool description to document structured response and line number usage
- Updated README with comprehensive documentation of new response format

### How to Use for Inline Comments
| Line Type | Line Number to Use | `line_type` param |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `ADDED` | `destination_line` | `"ADDED"` |
| `REMOVED` | `source_line` | `"REMOVED"` |
| `CONTEXT` | `destination_line` | `"CONTEXT"` |

### Note
- Bitbucket Cloud continues to use raw diff format (unchanged)
- Glob pattern filtering (`include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns`) still works client-side

## [1.1.3] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Fixed username encoding for Bitbucket Server participant endpoints**:
  - Usernames containing `+` characters (e.g., `user+1@domain.com`) are now properly converted to slug format
  - Both `@` and `+` are replaced with `_` to match Bitbucket Server's user slug format
  - Affects `approve_pull_request`, `unapprove_pull_request`, `request_changes`, and `remove_requested_changes` tools
  - Previously, the `+` character would cause 404 errors when approving/requesting changes on PRs

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **CI/CD build status support in `list_pr_commits` tool**:
  - Added `include_build_status` optional parameter to fetch build/CI status for pull request commits
  - Returns build status with counts: successful, failed, in_progress, and unknown builds
  - Uses same Bitbucket Server UI API endpoint as `list_branch_commits` for consistency
  - Graceful degradation: failures in fetching build status don't break commit listing
  - Currently only supports Bitbucket Server (Cloud has different build status APIs)
  - Useful for tracking CI/CD pipeline status for all commits in a pull request

### Changed
- Enhanced README.md with comprehensive documentation for new v1.1.0 features:
  - Added usage examples and documentation for `include_build_status` parameter in `list_branch_commits` tool
  - Added complete documentation for `list_projects` tool with examples, parameters, and response format
  - Added complete documentation for `list_repositories` tool with examples, parameters, and response format
  - Improved feature list to include new Project and Repository Discovery Tools section

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
